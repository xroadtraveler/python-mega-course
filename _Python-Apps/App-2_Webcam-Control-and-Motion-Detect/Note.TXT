FutureWarning Error:
Running program throws "FutureWarning" error when appending to the pandas DataFrame.

Warning reads:
"FutureWarning: The frame.append method is deprecated and will be removed 
from pandas in a future version. Use pandas.concat instead."


As this is just a practice program for a Udemy class, I'm not going to fix this right
away.  Couldn't find a simple solution online that worked with my existing code, and
I'd rather just continue my progress with the class.  

If I set up a motion-tracking camera program in the future, I'll look into it more
seriously, and possibly build more from scratch using more recent examples.  But
for now, I'll leave it as is.
